# Raymarcher

A simple raymarcher for rendering signed distance field (SDF) scenes

## Learning goals

 - 3D graphics
 - performance optimization in rust
 - Refresher on vector math
 - Rust polymorphism

## Project goals

 - [ ] SDF primitives
   - [x] Sphere
   - [x] Plane
   - [ ] Torus
   - [ ] Box
   - [ ] Rounded Box
   - [ ] Cone
   - [ ] Cylinder
 - [x] SDF Booleans
   - [x] Union
   - [x] Subtract
   - [x] Intersect
 - [ ] Smooth Stepping Booleans
 - [ ] Per-Entity Shading
 - [ ] Generic shading model
 - [ ] Phong shading
 - [ ] PBR shading

## Long term aspirations
 - Realtime 3D editing of scenes
 - Format for SDF scene definition
 - Serialization/deserialization of scenes for export/import
